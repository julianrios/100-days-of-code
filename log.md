# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 4, 2019 - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Created files, directories, and used Git on the terminal. Started Java Fundamentals

**Thoughts:** Git branching was difficult to visualize. Try mapping things out if you need a view. Need to improve on creating and removing files/directories from the terminal. Casting is not as accurate than using a primitive's object class.

### Day 1: February 5, 2019 - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercises involving predicates, Strings, and math. Started to handle user input.

**Thoughts**: I need to familiarize myself with the different classes the Java library offers instead of implementing my own solutions first. String Builder simplified reversing a string. Validation is key when dealing with user input.

### Day 2: February 6, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercises involving user input and started handling string formatting.

**Thoughts**: Walked through chapter 2 of BlueJ, answered questions about an objects, and manipulated the object via BlueJ. String formatting and nested loops can be tricky. Remember that %<number> number is a place holder for the field width. Useful tip outside loop handles rows inside loop handles columns or a wall scrolling game like mario. 
You must complete a level before you move on to the next world: 1-1 --> 1-2

### Day 3: February 7, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercises involving Math operations with BigIntegers, converting numbers into String hex/octcal/binary, using static methods from the Math class.

**Thoughts**: Using ternary operators with three variables is easier to read when you use two tenary operators one to store the value from the first set of values then one to check the result of the first set and the third variable. When handling BigIntegers you MUST use the methods provided in the BigInteger class to handle arithmetic operations on those variables. There is also constants for ZERO, ONE, and TEN.

### Day 4: February 8, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Traversing through an array 

**Thoughts**: Draw things out exactly what an array is doing when manipulating an array to do something for you. The visual aid will simply the process of working through an array with a loop or nested loop that is handling multiple indexes.

### Day 5: February 9, 2019 - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Created a branch outside of master, worked with PrintStream & InputStream, and worked logic processing of a calculator

**Thoughts:** Need to pratice more on branching and pull request be weary of where a pull request will go when you merge it with master. Always do a git fetch & git pull before a git push. PrintStream and Input Stream are essentially System.out and System.in need to formalize myself with more of this.

### Day 6: February 10, 2019 - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Demoed and submitted group final version of Scientific Calculator

**Thoughts**: When forking from another person's repo and trying to pull their changes remember ```git remote add [person-name] [their git url]```
```git pull [person name] master```
or ```git pull [their url] master``` when merging dev to master ```push from dev``` ```merge to master``` ```checkout master``` ```pull``` ```add and commit all new changes```  and ```push```

### Day 7: February 11, 2019 - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed a quiz based on various lessons covered throughout lastweek.

**Thoughts:** The acronym method was tricky. Remember to utilize the java library before you try to reinvent the wheel some methods maybe available to simply problems. Also become more familiar with the Caesar cipher and other cipher methods. Completed one method to remove consecutive duplicates with an ArrayList need to figure out how to with an array.

2. [BlueJ.StringArrayUtils](https://github.com/julianrios/BlueJ.StringArrayUtils.git)


### Day 8: February 12, 2019 - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed loop exercises involving while, for, and for each loops.

**Thoughts**: Learned that when looping through an array with for each the returned value is dependent on the type of object that the loop is iterating over. You must use .toString() on the returned type in order to get a string representation of it.

3. [Maven.StringsAndThings](https://github.com/julianrios/Maven.StringsAndThings.git)


### Day 9: February 13, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining exercise on iterating through a String and started work on TDD.

**Thoughts**: When using loops it is best practice to write it to see what every iteration is doing. Write out the string up to the index out of bounds. Remember as long as you don't access the index past the length you can not get out of bounds. When looping through an string try to be flexible work forward or backwards. If you are looking for a specific word look for the last letter and the letters before it to avoid checking something out of bounds.

### Day 10: February 14, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed TDD exercises, revisited some old concepts, and dove deep into a new collection. Tested my abilities on hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: TDD is alittle strange at first but once I started to get used to the concept of testing before implement I can see why it is so important to test you code for an expected action before implementing methods to generate those actual results. Should get easier as I practice more.

### Day 11: February 15, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing unit tests before writing code. 

**Thoughts**: Unit testing helped alot in creating this program. Remember to the process // given what you need to create to test (EXPECTED) // when is the method we are testing (ACTUAL) // then the assert that checks the expected and actual.

1. [Github-Repo](https://github.com/julianrios)


### Day 13: February 17, 2019 - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CashMachine project in JavaFX

**Thoughts**: JavaFX is similar to a web page the way event handlers are used. Need to better understand the component system and what is required to create applications in JavaFX. Just remember vbox, flowpane, stage, textfield, label, and lambdas. These are some fundamental pieces to constructing something in JavaFX.

### Day 14: February 18, 2019 - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed assessment 1. This covered work throughout the last two weeks.

**Thoughts:** The acronym method was tricky. Remember to utilize the java library before you try to reinvent the wheel some methods maybe available to simply problems. Also become more familiar with the Caesar cipher and other cipher methods. Completed one method to remove consecutive duplicates with an ArrayList need to figure out how to with an array.

### Day 16: February 20, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day reviewing material

**Thoughts**: Took the day to review the fundamentals and things that weren't clear. Going through a process like this isn't easy so rather than rush into the next big topic. Let thinks sink in and revisit things that didn't the first time around.

### Day 17: February 21, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created my own compareTo method to sort a collection

**Thoughts**: I praticed with the compareTo method and used the Collections.sort method to sort the order by name if not equal and by type if they were equal.

### Day 20: February 24, 2019 - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on BlackJack Game created methods to handle different aspects of the game with another peer.

**Thoughts**: Playing different versions of the game helped bring ideas together but I need to focus on mapping things out and sorting through those ideas to bridge the gap.

### Day 21: February 25, 2019 - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some bugs that appeared when running the game.

**Thoughts:** Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Remember to print out a messsages like looping here when stuck in a loop. Look at others' implementation as a guide when tackling problems. Always try to break big problems into smaller ones.

### Day 22: February 26, 2019 - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Refactored BlackJack Game and wrote tests

**Thoughts**: Testing first can be tough. But I need to practice it more to alleviate time spent working through bugs. When creating methods remember single purpose responsibility. Refactoring big methods into smaller ones with one purpose made the code more readable. Also using helper methods to call in multiple areas reduced duplicate code.

### Day 24: February 28, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Assessment One and worked on Dicey Lab

**Thoughts**: Continue practicing with arrays and read more about the api. I need to start focusing my attention towards collections and work more with sets, maps, lists. Utilize the comparator and comparable to sort my types.

### Day 25: March 1, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished implementation for Dicey Lab.

**Thoughts**: This was a tough lab. Break the problem apart next time. It's okay to put all you code in one method if you find it difficult to break it apart. Just follow up with a refactor to clean up the code. Need to write more tests cases.

### Day 26: March 2, 2019 - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Volunteered at I/O Tech Fest helping kids code on JSBattle and create an Alexa Skill

**Thoughts:** Practiced some of my newly developed skills to help kids learn how to create their own tanks and battle them against AI generated tanks on JSBattle. Teaching is alot of fun! I enjoyed guiding them as we worked through the documentation to build battle tanks. The alexa skill we created as well was really simple and easy once getting past the initial startup process. The kids were creative with their names and implementations of their alexa bots. I need to find more of these types of events to give back to the community and help show other people how much fun coding can be.
